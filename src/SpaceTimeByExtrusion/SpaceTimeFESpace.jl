# Create FE space in space only

# Create a dof-wise 1D space (time)


# Combine both in an extruded FE space
# Compute the local to global, dof numbering, Dirichlet, node coordinates, etc for the dof-wise tensor product space
# Extract the space-time basis and provide methods for gradient and time derivative.

# Create space-time quadratures and measures

# Combine all these ingredients for the high-level API
